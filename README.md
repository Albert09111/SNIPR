SNIPR is a software to design single nucleotide specific programmable riboregulator. 

#Requirements

SNIPR is using NUPACK3.2 to optimize the sequence design. To use SNIPR, please download and install [NUPACK3.2](http://www.nupack.org/). The installation guide of NUPACK can be found in NUPACK3.2 manual.
After the installation.

After the NUPACK installation, we need to add NUPACK to system’s environmental variables to make the usage more conveniently. 

Firstly, open the environment variable.

`open ~/.bash_profile`

In the text edit environment, add the NUPACK directory as the following example.

`export NUPACKHOME=/home/Documents/nupack3.2.0`
`export PATH=$PATH":${NUPACKHOME}/bin"`

After setting the environment variables, Matlab need to be opened from terminal to use NUPACK based functions. 

# Getting started
Before running the main code SNIPR.m，there are couple of parameters need to be specified by the users in the main function.

The size of library that the code will generate for each designs. For each target, there will be 9 conformation designs with different combination of forward and reverse toehold length, the total number of designs generated by the code will be the multiplication of library size and 9. We recommend to set the library number at least 10 to generate optimal designs. 

`library_num = 10;`

If your computer have multiple core, it’s better to take advantage of it to speed up the design process. 

`IS_PARALLEL = 1;`

This parameters is used to specify how many designs you want to try experimentally. The SNIPR design is challenging since it targets a very tiny difference. We recommend to try at least 5 designs to get successfully worked sensors. 

`select_num = 9;`

Sometimes, you may want to differentiate your WT target to SNP target, you can just specify it to be 0. 

`SNP_TARGET = 1;`

After finish the setting of the parameters, you can just run the main function SNIPR.m to generated the designs. The design may take some time to finish.
